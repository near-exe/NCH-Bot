Hi! This is a bot specifically made for the New Challenger discord server.

This is a WIP project so the README will change over time. The to do list may also change given that once i tackle each task i may or may not have to do extra stuff to make it work properly.

As a note also, this is my very first program that is going to be actually used so i want it to be good enough.

To do:
Configure firebase for the project.
Create commands for user registration with proper validations.
Create web scraper to pull the data from bucklers.
Map out data flow to maximize optimization.
Testing
Deployment (V1.0)
